## Music Is Ancient

Every known human culture makes music. Every one. There is no recorded exception.

Not every culture has writing. Not every culture has agriculture, or metallurgy, or monotheism. But every group of humans we've ever found — from isolated Amazonian communities to Arctic peoples to the earliest archaeological evidence of modern human behavior — makes music. Makes rhythm. Makes coordinated sound.

The oldest known musical instruments — bone flutes found in European caves — date to roughly 40,000 years ago. They appear in the archaeological record alongside the first evidence of symbolic thinking: cave paintings, carved figurines, beads, burial rituals. The emergence of art and the emergence of music are, as far as we can tell, the same event.

This is worth sitting with. At the exact moment humans began creating symbolic representations of the world — the cognitive capacity that would eventually produce language, mathematics, science, and every technology we've built since — they also began making music together. Not one before the other. Together.

What if that's not a coincidence? What if music isn't a pleasant side effect of brains that got big enough to think symbolically — but one of the foundational activities through which those brains organized themselves into societies?

## The Dismembering

Human civilizational capacities are powerful precisely because they separate.

Language separates meaning from the thing meant. Writing separates knowledge from the knower. Specialization separates domains from each other. Institutions enforce those separations — academic disciplines, professional roles, legal categories, cultural boundaries.

These separations are not failures. They're features. They make possible science, law, medicine, engineering, global coordination. The ability to isolate, abstract, categorize, and scale is what built the world we live in. We are surrounded by its gifts. Antibiotics exist because someone specialized in microbiology. Bridges stand because structural engineering separated itself from philosophy. The capacity to read these words depends on layers upon layers of productive separation — alphabet from pictograph, grammar from speech, printing from manuscript, screen from page.

But there are costs.

Specialization separates mind from body. Self from other. Feeling from meaning. Expression from reception. Present from past. It separates *domains* from each other — art from healing from governance from knowledge-making — and maintains those separations institutionally. A university has a music department and a psychology department and a philosophy department, and they largely don't talk to each other. A hospital has a physical therapy wing and a mental health wing. Your body is one kind of problem; your mind is another.

Call this **dismembering**. Not in the violent sense — though there's violence in it — but in the literal sense: pulling apart the members of a whole. Civilization's great power is dis-membering. Taking what was integrated and separating it into parts that can be independently developed, refined, and scaled.

The question is what gets lost along the way.

## Technologies of Remembering

Different practices restore different kinds of integration.

**Books** remember ideas across time. A book takes knowledge that would otherwise die with its knower and makes it available to strangers across centuries. It re-members meaning and duration — connects a mind in the present to a mind in the past.

**Meditation** remembers presence. It trains the capacity to attend to inner experience without being swept away by it — restoring a relationship between the self and its own attention that compulsive productivity erodes. It re-members the self and its awareness.

**Psychotherapy** remembers emotional wholeness. It creates a container where split-off experiences can be reintegrated — where what was too painful to feel can be felt, named, and returned to the self.

**Team sports** remember the body in coordinated action. They demand that you be physically present, responsive to others, moving together toward a shared goal. They re-member the body and the group.

**Protest and collective action** remember the body politic. They put bodies together in space to make a collective visible to itself and to the world.

Each of these is a **technology of remembering** — a practice that re-members what civilization has dis-membered. They put back together what the dominant capacities pulled apart.

The term is deliberate. These are technologies — not in the narrow sense of gadgets, but in the older sense: systematic methods for achieving a result. A sonnet is a technology. A twelve-step program is a technology. A roda is a technology. They are engineered, refined, transmitted. They have design principles, failure modes, and experts who understand them deeply.

And they all specialize. Books are strong on meaning but weak on embodiment. Meditation is strong on interiority but can be isolating. Team sports build coordination but don't generate transmissible knowledge about what they're doing or why. Each practice remembers some dimensions of integration while leaving others collapsed.

## Three Orientations

There's a pattern inside the specialization — a spatial pattern worth naming.

Consider, for a moment, the question: where does the action happen? Not what kind of processing, but where is the locus of the activity?

There are at least three orientations of human experience. Three directions the attention can face, three kinds of work that need doing.

**Outward, toward the world.** This is the orientation of computation — problem-solving, analysis, manipulation of the environment. We have built an entire civilization of tools for this orientation. Calculators, databases, search engines, spreadsheets, telescopes, microscopes, and now machine learning systems and large language models. The outward orientation is where the vast majority of our technological investment has gone.

The word "computation" is precise here. Before we built machines to compute, we called certain people "computers" — human beings whose job was to perform sequential calculations. When we automated that labor, we gave the machines the name. Computation is, specifically, the set of operations a machine can replicate. That is not a narrow category. It turns out to include a staggering range of human cognitive activity — writing, analyzing, translating, diagnosing, designing, coding. AI is in the process of revealing just how much of what we called "thinking" was, in a technical sense, computation all along.

**Inward, toward the self.** This is the orientation of contemplation — meditation, prayer, mindfulness, introspection, the cultivation of awareness and presence. The inner orientation has a long history across every spiritual and philosophical tradition, but in the modern secular West it atrophied for a while. It is now being rediscovered. The mindfulness movement, the psychedelic renaissance, the boom in meditation apps and breathwork practices — these are real, and they matter.

**Between people, in shared time.** This is the orientation that has almost no language. The space between bodies — not inside any one person, not out in the abstract world — but in the exchange itself. The loop where your output becomes my input and we are both transformed. The place where a groove lives, where a conversation catches fire, where a roda generates something that no individual in the circle is producing.

Three orientations. We are massively developed in the first. Actively rediscovering the second. And almost illiterate in the third.

That illiteracy is the gap this book is about.

The "between" is where musical relationality lives. And the mechanism is worth being specific about. When people enter a shared musical framework — a groove, a rhythm, a song — they are extending their cognitive processes onto a shared temporal structure. The beat is not just in the speakers or in any one body. It becomes a scaffold that multiple minds synchronize around. People think through it, feel through it, coordinate through it. The music becomes a shared cognitive framework — an external structure that people can extend their minds onto, merge through, connect through.

This is not a metaphor. Cognitive science increasingly recognizes that cognition is not locked inside individual skulls. It extends into tools, environments, other people. Musical time is one of the most powerful such extensions available to the species — a shared temporal framework that allows multiple nervous systems to entrain, coordinate, and produce collective behavior that no individual directs.

The between is real. It has a mechanism. And certain practices have been cultivating it with extraordinary sophistication for a very long time.

## Why Afro-Diasporic Specifically?

The choreo-musical systems I study — capoeira, rumba, bomba, jazz, the social dance floor — emerged under specific conditions. They were developed by communities under displacement, enslavement, and oppression. Communities where the capacity to coordinate wasn't a lifestyle choice — it was survival.

When your language has been taken, when your family structure has been destroyed, when your freedom of assembly is restricted, when the surrounding systems are actively hostile to your existence — the technologies you develop for maintaining coherence, transmitting knowledge, building trust, and coordinating action are not luxuries. They're load-bearing infrastructure.

These traditions didn't develop in the comfort of specialization. They couldn't afford to separate music from governance from healing from philosophy from resistance. They had to do it all at once, with whatever tools were available, in whatever space could be carved out.

That's why these systems are integrative. Not because their creators lacked the sophistication to specialize. Because the conditions demanded integration.

And that integration — the refusal to separate what civilizational logic says must be separated — is precisely what makes them such powerful technologies of remembering. They remember the between. They remember the body. They remember the collective. They remember all of these at once, because they were never designed to pull them apart.
